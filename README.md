# tribble-project
this project started as an experiment with a wii nunchuck, an arduino uno, and a strip of individually addressable leds
I quickly realized it would make a compelling toy and started tweaking the set up to make it portable and friendly
the current hardware is:
-arduino pro mini 5v
-5v-3v logic level converter
-sparkfun 6 degrees of freedom IMU
-6 strips of WS2812b leds, 8 leds per strip
-the guts of a rechargable backup battery
all inside a 4in clear plastic globe with faux fur

Future improvements:
-3d printed enclosure
-custom printed pcb
-vibrating motor(purring/humming)
